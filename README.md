## Why have I decided to build a keyboard?
A few years ago I received an 80% mechanical keyboard as a Christmas gift. It has been my daily driver since then.
But it has two issues:
1. It is too big and chunky to travel with or take it to school.
2. It is too loud. While it is quieter than some mechanical keyboards, you can easily hear it from the other side of my flat.

Since then Youtube algorithm has introduced me into the custom keyboard rabbit hole.
I've built a simple one using 3d printed parts and handwiring. It worked, but it was thick and after a few weeks it started to slowly break apart. First random solder joints started breaking, then the case cracked.

I wanted to build a proper keyboard, but I was too lazy to do it.
Highway gave me the motivation that I needed to finally do it.

## Switch layout
Switch layout was inspired by two keyboards I like: ZSA Voyager and Sofle
